# Introduction

Derealize is a TailwindCSS Editor play with the development running front-end project.

Traditional tailwindcss editors (e.g. [windicss.org/play](https://windicss.org/play.html)) edits an html component that is separate from the front-end project. After each edit, you need to manually synchronize the html component to your front-end project. The modular nesting of a front-end project may be very complicated and uncertain. Until I saw [ui-devtools](https://www.ui-devtools.com) (thanks for the inspiration it gave). It play with the front-end project rather than html components. Unfortunately, its working model limits UI design to the hands of front-end engineers (can't avoid some professional command line knowledge). So I thought that if I could integrate the node/git environment in an electron application, people not familiar with any code knowledge could also edit the UI of real front-end projects with the help of tailwindcss and get into the CI/CD pipeline! It seems that this goal is a bit whimsical, I hope we can approach it.
